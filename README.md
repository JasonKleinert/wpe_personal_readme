# Personal README
Hello, welcome to my personal README!

## My Goals

My Goals at WP Engine include:
- Be a good teammate
- Learn as much as I can
- Work with new and new to me technologies
- Deliver high quality code

## Things you should know about me
I'm an early riser and start work early. My work day ends at 4 pm (excepting emergencies/critical meetings), so I can pick up my daughter from daycare and spend time with her before she goes to bed at 7 pm. After 7 pm I can be available again if that's required.

Outside of work, I like to spend time in the outdoors. I have an interest in nature which leads me to fascinating places and unforgettable experiences.

## What I value
- Open and direct communication
- Continued personal and professional growth
- Thoughtful development cycles over fast iteration (I'd rather spend engineering time up front with intention rather than down the road as a reaction to something we missed)
- Clear and relevant documentation

## The Day-To-Day

### PRs & Code reviews
I'm on the look out for PRs in our repos as much as possible, it's easy for something to sneak by though. Don't be afraid to tell me if you have something that needs a review.

### Communication
I prefer to communicate in whichever way is best for you. The quickest way to get in touch with me is Slack. I'm always happy to get on a Zoom call, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to get together to discuss anything.
